## Data Collection/Loading

First step is to download the CNV data set from firebrowse that relates to the full set of kinases. This was a bit painful, as it appears that there is some sort of throttling going on that keeps this from working all in one shot.

```{r}
CNV_calls = list()

gene_CNV_calls = list()

if (!dir.exists(here('CNV_analysis','data'))) {
  dir.create(here('CNV_analysis','data'),recursive = T)
}

#A few of the HUGO gene names are not present in the TCGA data, filter those out
missing_genes = c("COQ8A","COQ8B","GRK2","GRK3","HASPIN","MAP3K20","MAP3K21",
                  "NIM1K","PAK5","POMK","PRAG1","PRKY","SBK3","STK26","STKLD1")
valid_genes = all_kinases %>%
  filter(!symbol %in% missing_genes)

this_bar = progress_bar$new(total = length(valid_genes$symbol));
for (gene in valid_genes$symbol) {
  page_num = 1;
  
  while (!is.na(page_num)) {
    #this is all a bit of a hack, but sometimes the API needs multiple tries to
    #return a set of results, most of the time the second attempt goes through,
    #I'm not why this is, but here we are
    api_success = F;
    while(!api_success) {
      tryCatch (
        {
          #had to set this temp variable to deal with the return value from the
          #firebrowse output being incompatible with dropping right into a list
          temp = Analyses.CopyNumber.Genes.Thresholded(
            gene      = as.character(gene),
            page_size = 2000,
            format    ='csv',
            page      = page_num);
          if (!is.null(temp)) {
            gene_CNV_calls[[gene]][[page_num]] = temp;
            api_success = T;
          }
        }
      )
    }
    
    #only the first page will have the column headers, add them back to susequent
    #pages
    if (page_num > 1) {
      names(gene_CNV_calls[[gene]][[page_num]]) <- names(gene_CNV_calls[[gene]][[1]])
    }
    
    #a return of less than the full requested 2000 entries means we are at the end
    #of the mutation set
    
    if (dim(gene_CNV_calls[[gene]][[page_num]])[1] < 2000) {
      page_num = NA;
    } else {
      page_num = page_num + 1;
    }
  }
  
  gene_CNV_calls[[gene]] = data.frame(do.call(rbind,gene_CNV_calls[[gene]]),row.names = NULL)
  this_bar$tick()
}

CNV_calls = data.frame(do.call(rbind,gene_CNV_calls),row.names = NULL)
write_rds(CNV_calls,here('CNV_analysis','data','kinase_CNV.rds'))
```
